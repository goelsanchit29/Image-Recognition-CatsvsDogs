# Plant-Disease-Image-Detection
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient image detection system that can accurately identify and classify diseases in plants from images. This system aims to assist farmers, agronomists, and agricultural professionals in early detection and diagnosis of plant diseases, thereby enabling timely intervention and management practices to reduce crop losses and improve yield.
