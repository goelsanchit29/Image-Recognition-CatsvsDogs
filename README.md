Image Recognition Cats vs Dogs

The "Cats vs Dogs Image Detection" project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying images of cats and dogs. Utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project will create a system that can distinguish between cats and dogs with high accuracy. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images, optimized, and evaluated to ensure reliable performance.
